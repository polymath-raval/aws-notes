- EC2
	- Elastic Cloud Compute
	- Resizable Compute Capacity in Cloud
	- Horizontal and Vertical upscale and downscale on demand

	- Options:
		- On Demand
			- pay per timeunit (second/minute/hour) of usage
			- no commitment
			- no upfront payments
			- usecases short term, spiky, unpreditable workloads

		- Reserved
			- contractual usage obligation
			- 1 Year or 3 Year contracts
			- offers a significant discount on On Demand Instance
			- scenario: steady state or predictable usage
			- options:
				- Standard (upto 75% off-demand)
				- Convertable (upto 75% off-demand)
				- Scheduled 

		- Spot
			- bid for instance(s) at desired prices
			- pay per hour
			- instance allocated till & when the desired price is applicable
			- applications should have flexible start and end times
			- Partial usage charges are not billed incase terminated by Amazon
			- Partial usage charges are billed incase terminated by user
			- scenario: RnD use cases requiring large amount compute capacity

		- Dedicated
			- Physical EC2 servers for dedicated use
			- scenario: useful in scenarios of leveraging server-bound software licenses
			- scenario: regularory requirement that may not support multitenant virtualization
			- options:
				- On Demand (timeunit: hourly)
				- Reservations (70% on demand price)

	- Types: ...

	- EBS
		- Elastic Block Storage
		- A virtual hard disk attached to the EC2 instance
		- also called volumes
		- a root volume is where an os is installed
		- Replicated to prevent failure of a single component
		- Disk where softwares can be installed
		- Options:
			- General Purpose SSD (GP2)
				- scenario: Standard Servers
			- Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01)
				- scenario: Mission Critical Apps e.g. SQL or no SQL DB
			- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) (cannot be a boot volume)
				- scenario: frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workload e.g. Bigdata
			- Cold HDD (cannot be a boot volume)
				- scenario: low cost less frequenty used workloads e.g. FileServer
			- Magentic (Standard)
				- scenario: dev/uat/ cheap boot volume
		- We can upgrade space and option of a volume even after its attached to an instance, no downtime incurred
		- The EC2 Instance and the volume has to be in the same Availability Zone
		- Inorder to create a EC2 Instance in  Availability Zone A with the desired volume in Availability Zone B, take a snapshot of the volume and recreate a volume in Availability Zone A with the snapshot
		- While taking snapshots of a volume, it is a incremental method. Only changes are saved in a sequence of snapshot of the volumes

		- Snahoshots/AMI notes:
			- Stop the instance before taking a snapshot of the root volume (best practise)
			- Snapshot of an un-encrypted volume would be un-encrypted
			- Snapshot of an encrypted volume would be encrypted
			- To convert an un-encrypted snapshot to encrypted, copy the snapshot and command it to be encrypted
			- AMI avaible on market place always have to be un-encrypted.
			- Volumes created from encrypted snapshots are encrypted
			- Volumes created from un-encrypted snapshots are un-encrypted
			- Keys of encryption are stored within account. That makes it impossible to share encrypted snapshots/ami to another account



	- Amazon Machine Imange
		- Boot Volume => Snapshot => Amazon Machine Imange
		- EC2 Instance => Amazon Machine Imange



	- Security Group
		- First level of defense against unathorized connection to EC2 Instance
		- Defines how can one connect from Public Internet with the Instance, which protocol/originating ip addres/incoming port
		- One EC2 instance can be behind many security groups
		- Rules are stateful. Meaning if you add a inbound rule, it will put required outbound rule
		- Any changes made to security are immediate
		- By default every traffic is blocked by Security Group, so rules are only for whitelisting not black listing
		- Given the fact that only whitelisting is allowed in security groups, when a EC2 Instance is behind more than one security group, the effective is additive in nature. No conflicts are possible as ther eis no black listing
	

	
	- Lab1:
		- Termination is turned off by default
		- On EBS-backed instances, when the instance is deleted the Volume is also deleted by default
		- On EBS Root volumes of default AMI's cannot be encrypted
			- for doing the same, take the snapshot of the EBS volume of the created volume and encrypted the copy
