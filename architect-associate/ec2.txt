	- Types: ...

	- EBS
		- Elastic Block Storage
		- A virtual hard disk attached to the EC2 instance
		- also called volumes
		- a root volume is where an os is installed
		- Replicated to prevent failure of a single component
		- Disk where softwares can be installed
		- Options:
			- General Purpose SSD (GP2)
				- scenario: Standard Servers
			- Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01)
				- scenario: Mission Critical Apps e.g. SQL or no SQL DB
			- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) (cannot be a boot volume)
				- scenario: frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workload e.g. Bigdata
			- Cold HDD (cannot be a boot volume)
				- scenario: low cost less frequenty used workloads e.g. FileServer
			- Magentic (Standard)
				- scenario: dev/uat/ cheap boot volume
		- We can upgrade space and option of a volume even after its attached to an instance, no downtime incurred
		- The EC2 Instance and the volume has to be in the same Availability Zone
		- Inorder to create a EC2 Instance in  Availability Zone A with the desired volume in Availability Zone B, take a snapshot of the volume and recreate a volume in Availability Zone A with the snapshot
		- While taking snapshots of a volume, it is a incremental method. Only changes are saved in a sequence of snapshot of the volumes

		- Snahoshots/AMI notes:
			- Stop the instance before taking a snapshot of the root volume (best practise)
			- Snapshot of an un-encrypted volume would be un-encrypted
			- Snapshot of an encrypted volume would be encrypted
			- To convert an un-encrypted snapshot to encrypted, copy the snapshot and command it to be encrypted
			- AMI avaible on market place always have to be un-encrypted.
			- Volumes created from encrypted snapshots are encrypted
			- Volumes created from un-encrypted snapshots are un-encrypted
			- Keys of encryption are stored within account. That makes it impossible to share encrypted snapshots/ami to another account



	- Amazon Machine Imange (AMI)
		- Boot Volume => Snapshot => Amazon Machine Imange
		- EC2 Instance => Amazon Machine Imange
		- AMI which has to be stored with another account cannot be encrypted
		- AMI can be selected with:
			- Region
			- Operating System
			- Architectures (32 bits vs 64 bits)
			- Launch Permissions
			- Root Decive Type (EBS/Instance Store)
				- Instace Store (Ephemeral Storage)
					- cannot be stopped, it can only rebooted or terminated
					- Depriciated
					- Less Durable
					- volume is created by a template stored in Amazon S3
					- Deleted always with termination of the instance
					- ** HAS A AMAZING SPEED AS THE HDD IS ON THE PHYSICAL INSTANCE **
				- EBS Backed Volumes
					- can be started/stopped/rebooted/terminated
					- More Durable
					- Can be detached from live instance and attached to another instance
					- volume is created by EBS Snapshot
					- Option of being not deleted on termination of the instance
					- ** NOT AS FAST AS INSTANCE STORE AS THE HDD IS BACKED BY EBS VOLUME SITTING ON NETWORK, THATS THE REASON OF LIMITED IOPS **

	- Security Group
		- First level of defense against unathorized connection to EC2 Instance
		- Defines how can one connect from Public Internet with the Instance, which protocol/originating ip addres/incoming port
		- One EC2 instance can be behind many security groups
		- Rules are stateful. Meaning if you add a inbound rule, it will put required outbound rule
		- Any changes made to security are immediate
		- By default every traffic is blocked by Security Group, so rules are only for whitelisting not black listing
		- Given the fact that only whitelisting is allowed in security groups, when a EC2 Instance is behind more than one security group, the effective is additive in nature. No conflicts are possible as ther eis no black listing
	
	- Load Balancers
		- Balances the load acc
		- X-Forwarded-For Header contains the IPv4 of the actual user
		- Parameters requied to configure:
			- Routing details (Incoming Protocal:Port => Outgoing Protocol:Port)
			- Ping Protocol:Port:Path
			- Ping Respoonse Timeout
			- Ping Interval
			- Unhealthy threshold (Number of ping to fail consecutively for Instance to be marked unhealthy)
			- Healthy threshold (Number of ping to successed after it marked unhealth to be marked healthy)

		- Types
			- Application Load Balancer
				- Operates @ Level 7
				- best suited for http/https traffic
				- very intelligent load balancers
				- request routing can be done looking into the actual request
			- Network Load Balancer
				- Operates @ Level 4
				- best suited for tcp traffic where extreme performance is required
			- Classic Load Balancer
				- Legecy Elastic Load Balancers
				- Operates a bit at layer 7 & layer 4
				- Layer 7 can only rely on sticky session or X-Forwarded-For
		- Errors (** ERROR CODE 504 **)
			- this is the error when the request at Load Balancer times out
			- underlying applicaiton has not responed within the time frame required
	
	- Lab1:
		- Termination is turned off by default
		- On EBS-backed instances, when the instance is deleted the Volume is also deleted by default
		- On EBS Root volumes of default AMI's cannot be encrypted
			- for doing the same, take the snapshot of the EBS volume of the created volume and encrypted the copy
