-S3
	- Simple Storage Service
	- secure (secured via IAM)
	- durable (data stored in different locations/devices)
	- highly scalabe (can be used to store any amount of data)
	- object store (billed per object, no hierarchy)
	- exposed via web services (access via api, website etc., all uses underlying webservices)
	- cannot be used to install os, softwares etc., (Block based storage should be used for that)
	- Max Size 5 TB for a single file
	- S3 has a universal namespce although the bucket is region specific
	- Consistency:
		- New Object (PUTS) => Immediate Read after Write
		- Existing Object (PUTS, DELETE) => Eventual Read after Write
	- S3 Object consists of:
		- Key
		- Value
		- Version Id
		- Metadata
		- Access Control Lists (ACL)
		- Torrent

	- Charges Applied
		- Storage 
			- Space taken by object
		- Requests 
			- Number of times the object was updated/deleted/downloaded
		- Storage Management Pricing
			- Number of tags attached to the objects
		- Data Transfer Pricing
			- data transfer fees object incase objects replicated across regions
		- Transfer Acceleration
			- Usecase:
				- Users spread across the world e.g. South America
				- Bucket located in one of the regions. e.g. Mumbai
				- Amazon has some thing called Edge Locations which is leverged in Cloud Front which is the Content Delievery Network(CDN) for amazon
				- Users in South America will transfer the object to a  edge location near to them
				- Once the object is tranfered to the edge location then the object would be tranfered to bucket using dedicated amazon lines
			- Charged if such a facility is enabled
